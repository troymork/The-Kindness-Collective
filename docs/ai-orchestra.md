# AI Orchestra
Modular team that plans, produces, repurposes, connects, and learns.

- Orchestrator: calendar + briefs
- Live Producer: run-of-show
- Repurposer: clips + crossposting
- Community: conversations
- Connector: collaborations
- Booking: guests + consent
- Insights: analysis + trends
- Compliance: safety
- Sparkle Scribe: kindness quests

RACI: Orchestrator owns schedule; Producer leads Live; Repurposer owns post.
