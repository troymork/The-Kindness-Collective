# The Kindness Collective (TKC)
**TKC** is the community heart of **SPARK**. It’s where awakened people gather to share stories, practice kindness, and co-create projects. TKC uses a symphony of AI agents to orchestrate cross‑platform content, daily live conversations, and a “Kindness River” that weaves TikTok, Instagram, YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn, and X into one shared flow.

## Why TKC
- People enter through **story and resonance**… TKC is the welcoming hearth.
- **SPARK** measures and amplifies kindness with quests and rewards.
- Together they form a humane prototype of the Agreement Economy.

## What’s inside
- **/prompts**: Production-ready system prompts for the AI agent orchestra.
- **/docs**: Vision, runbooks, platform strategy, SPARK integration, safety.
- **/workflows**: Pipelines for daily Lives, crossposting, analytics loops.
- **/scripts**: Helper scripts for bootstrapping and Git.
- **/branding**: Seed notes for logo and visual language.

## Quickstart
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill values as integrations are added.
2. Read `/docs/kindness-hour-runbook.md` and schedule your first Live.
3. Start with two agents: **Orchestrator** and **Repurposer**. Add others over time.

## Principles
- **Kindness first**… safety and compassion are non‑negotiable.
- **Sovereignty**… voice and consent are honored.
- **Co‑creation**… iteration is normal.
- **Measurement without judgment**… SPARK rewards action and growth.
